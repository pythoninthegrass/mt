## Development

### Auto-Reload Utility

The `repeater` script provides automatic reloading for Tkinter applications during development, extending tkreload functionality to watch multiple files and directories simultaneously.

#### Installation

```bash
uv sync --all-extras  # Install all dependencies including watchdog
```

#### Run the app

```bash
# Watch main.py and default directories (core/, utils/)
uv run python repeater

# Watch a specific main file
uv run python repeater main.py
```

#### Watched Paths

By default, watches:

* **Main file**: `main.py` (or specified file)
* **core/**: Business logic directory (recursive)
* **utils/**: Utilities directory (recursive)

#### Runtime Commands

* **`h`**: Show help and current status
* **`r`**: Manual restart of the application
* **`a`**: Toggle auto-reload on/off
* **`Ctrl+C`**: Exit the application gracefully

#### Features

* Multi-directory watching
* Content-aware reloading (only when content changes)
* Rich console output with progress indicators
* Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
