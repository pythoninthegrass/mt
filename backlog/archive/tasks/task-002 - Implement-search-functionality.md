<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Notes

Implemented type-to-jump functionality in QueueView class (core/gui.py). Users can now type artist names (e.g., 'g-u-i' within 1.5s) to jump to the first matching artist in the library view. Added setup_type_to_jump(), on_key_press_jump(), _jump_to_artist(), and _reset_type_buffer() methods with Eliot logging. Timeout is 1.5 seconds between keypresses.

Known limitation: macOS system beep occurs when typing in Tkinter Treeview widgets. This is a Tkinter/macOS limitation and cannot be suppressed without invasive system-level changes. The beep does not affect functionality.
