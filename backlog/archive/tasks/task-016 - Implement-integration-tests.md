## Description

Add integration tests for component interactions and end-to-end workflows

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Set up integration test framework
- [x] #2 Write tests for player-library integration
- [x] #3 Write tests for UI-database integration
- [x] #4 Write tests for queue management workflows
- [x] #5 Test cross-component functionality
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Completed all acceptance criteria:

AC#1 - Integration test framework was already set up with:

- conftest.py with app_process, api_client, clean_queue fixtures
- APIClient helper for API communication
- Test database isolation
- Real VLC and music file support

AC#2 - Player-library integration tests added/enhanced:

- test_play_from_library_selection (existing)
- test_library_and_queue_interaction (existing)
- test_library_search_to_playback_workflow (new comprehensive test)

AC#3 - UI-database integration tested through:

- All E2E tests verify database state via API
- Queue persistence tests (add/remove/get_queue)
- Library persistence tests (get_library, search)
- View state preservation tests

AC#4 - Queue management workflows comprehensively tested:

- 10 existing queue tests in test_e2e_queue.py
- Add, remove, clear, play at index, selection
- Error handling for invalid indices

AC#5 - Cross-component functionality tested with:

- 6 new comprehensive integration workflow tests in test_e2e_integration.py
- Library → Queue → Player workflows
- Shuffle mode across components
- Loop mode with queue exhaustion
- Multi-view queue operations
- Error recovery workflows
- Concurrent operations testing

Total: 59 E2E/integration tests, all passing in ~25s
