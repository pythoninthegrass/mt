## Description

Implement structured logging for toggle_loop and toggle_shuffle methods in controls.py to capture user interactions with playback mode controls. The logging should record state changes including both old and new values to provide complete audit trail of user preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 toggle_loop method includes start_action logging with old and new loop state values,toggle_shuffle method includes start_action logging with old and new shuffle state values,All toggle operations log the user interaction trigger and resulting state change,Logging follows established pattern with log_player_action helper function,State change context includes meaningful descriptions of the toggle actions,No existing functionality is broken by the logging additions
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented structured logging for toggle controls. Added start_action context and log_player_action calls for both toggle_loop and toggle_shuffle methods. Captured old and new state values with meaningful descriptions ('Loop/Shuffle mode enabled/disabled'). All functionality tested and working correctly with no breaking changes.
