## Description

Add structured logging to player.py seek method and progress bar interactions to track user seeking behavior with timestamp positions and differentiate between drag and click interactions

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Log records user seeking with accurate timestamp positions,Log differentiates between drag vs click seeking interactions,Log includes seek source identification (progress bar keyboard etc),Seek logging integrates with existing Eliot logging system,Log entries include before and after position context
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented structured logging for seek operations. Added source and interaction_type parameters to differentiate between drag vs click interactions. Updated all seek calls to pass appropriate parameters. Added comprehensive position tracking with old/new timestamps, duration, and percentage context.
