## Description

Implement comprehensive structured logging for stoplight buttons (close/minimize/maximize) in gui.py to track window management actions. This logging will help understand user window behavior patterns and provide context for window state changes including position and size information.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Close/minimize/maximize actions from stoplight buttons are logged with structured Eliot actions,Window state and position context is included in log entries,User window management patterns are trackable through log entries,Logging differentiates stoplight actions from keyboard shortcuts,All window management operations include before/after window state
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Implementation complete. Added structured logging to all stoplight button actions in core/stoplight.py: close_window, minimize_window (with disabled state), and toggle_maximize with comprehensive window state tracking including geometry changes, screen dimensions, and before/after states.
