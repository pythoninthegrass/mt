## Description

Implement comprehensive structured logging for UI preference modifications including column width changes and panel resize operations. This logging will help track user interface customization patterns and provide context for preference persistence actions.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Column width changes are logged with old and new values in structured Eliot actions,Panel resize operations are tracked with before and after dimensions,Preference persistence actions are logged when settings are saved,User interface customization patterns are trackable through log entries,All preference changes include relevant context about the UI component affected
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Implementation complete. Added structured logging to UI preference changes: check_column_changes() in gui.py tracks column width changes with before/after values, save_column_widths() in player.py logs preference persistence with database comparison, and on_paned_resize() in player.py logs panel resizing with width changes and window geometry.
