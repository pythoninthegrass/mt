## Implementation Notes

Successfully installed CustomTkinter 5.2.2 via uv. Configured dark appearance mode and blue color theme. Modified main.py to import and initialize CustomTkinter while preserving existing TkinterDnD functionality for drag-and-drop support. Application loads correctly with new theming foundation ready for UI component upgrades.
