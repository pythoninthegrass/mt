## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 CTkEntry search widget created and positioned
- [x] #2 Real-time filtering implemented with debounced search
- [x] #3 Search integrates with existing library data

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented search functionality with CustomTkinter CTkEntry widget. Added SearchBar class to core/gui.py with real-time filtering, debounced search (300ms), and keyboard shortcuts (Enter, Escape, Ctrl+F). Integrated search callbacks into MusicPlayer with perform_search() and clear_search() methods. Added search_library() and search_queue() methods to LibraryManager and QueueManager. Implemented database search methods with LIKE queries across artist, title, and album fields. Search bar positioned at top-right of interface matching MusicBee design. Visual feedback includes placeholder text and proper focus states.

VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS:

- Made top bar continuous and pure black (#000000) like MusicBee interface
- Replaced emoji magnifying glass with Unicode equivalent (âŒ• U+2315) 
- Enhanced search entry styling with dark theme colors
- Added proper text colors for visibility on black background
- Removed corner radius and borders for seamless bar appearance
