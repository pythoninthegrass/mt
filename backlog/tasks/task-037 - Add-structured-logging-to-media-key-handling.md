## Description

Implement comprehensive structured logging for hardware media key press events in utils/mediakeys.py to track user interactions with physical media controls. This logging should differentiate between different trigger sources (GUI vs media_key vs keyboard) and provide detailed context about which media key was pressed.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Media key press events are logged with start_action context including key type (play/pause, next, previous),Logging differentiates between trigger sources (gui vs media_key vs keyboard),All media key interactions include appropriate metadata and context,Logging follows established pattern with log_player_action helper function,No existing functionality is broken by the logging additions
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented structured logging for media key handling. Added start_action context around media key events, differentiated trigger sources with 'media_key' identifier, included key type metadata (play_pause, next, previous), and followed established log_player_action pattern. All tests pass and functionality remains intact.
