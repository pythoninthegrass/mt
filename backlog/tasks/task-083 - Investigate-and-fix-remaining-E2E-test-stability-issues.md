## Description

After implementing pytest-order, 536/555 tests pass in full suite run (96.6%). Remaining issues: (1) App crashes after 536 tests due to cumulative resource exhaustion before stress tests can run. (2) The 100-operation stress test crashes app even in isolation. (3) Consider implementing test splaying - spreading E2E tests throughout the run instead of batching them, to give app recovery time between tests.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Reduce sleep delays in conftest.py clean_queue from 0.1s to minimum needed (may not need any)
- [x] #2 Fix or skip test_stress_test_100_rapid_next_operations (100 rapid next operations)
- [x] #3 Investigate splaying E2E tests during full suite run instead of running them consecutively
- [ ] #4 Profile resource usage to identify why app crashes after 536 tests
- [ ] #5 All 555 tests pass consistently in full suite run
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Notes

COMPLETED: Implemented automatic test ordering via pytest hook in conftest.py. Tests now run in optimal order: Unit (fast) → Property (fast) → E2E (app-dependent) → Stress tests (last). This completely fixes the regression where E2E tests were running first and hanging the suite. 

Results: **536/555 tests pass (96.6%)**, no startup hanging, deterministic ordering. 

Remaining failures: 
- 3 rate limiting unit tests (task-084)
- 11 connection errors after app crash at 96% from cumulative exhaustion (expected with session-scoped fixture)

The core ordering issue is SOLVED. Test suite went from 0% pass rate (hung at startup) to 96.6% pass rate.
