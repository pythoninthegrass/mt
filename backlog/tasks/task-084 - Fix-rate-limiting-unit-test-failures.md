## Description

Three rate limiting unit tests are failing with 'error' instead of 'success': test_rate_limit_pending_timer_executes, test_rate_limit_play_pause_faster_interval, test_rapid_next_operations_with_rate_limiting. These tests were working before but now consistently fail. Need to investigate why rate limiting is returning error status.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Identify root cause of rate limiting test failures
- [x] #2 Fix the failing tests or update expectations if behavior changed
- [x] #3 Verify all 3 rate limiting tests pass
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Notes

Fixed rate limiting test failures. Root cause: tests were using 'filepath' parameter but API expects 'files' (as list). Also added 'current_index' field to get_status API response for test compatibility.
