## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
When a context menu submenu (e.g., "Add to Playlist") contains many items, it can extend beyond the vertical viewport bounds. The submenu should:

1. Detect when its height would exceed the available viewport space
2. Constrain the submenu height to fit within the viewport
3. Add vertical scrolling (overflow-y: auto) to allow access to all items
4. Optionally show scroll indicators (fade gradients or scroll shadows) at top/bottom when scrollable

This applies to:
- The "Add to Playlist" submenu in the track context menu
- Any future submenus that may have dynamic/variable content
