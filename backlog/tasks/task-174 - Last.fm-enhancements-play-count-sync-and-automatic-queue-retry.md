## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Follow-up enhancements from task-007 that were deferred after core scrobbling was completed.

These are nice-to-have features that would improve the Last.fm integration but are not required for basic scrobbling functionality.

## Play Count Sync
Sync local play count to Last.fm track.scrobble API (already sends count, just need to verify/test).

## Automatic Queue Retry
Design options from task-007:
- **Option A**: Startup retry - call `retry_queued_scrobbles()` in backend/main.py lifespan after DB init
- **Option B**: Periodic background task - asyncio task every 5min
- **Option C**: Frontend on auth success - call retry in `completeLastfmAuth()`
- **Option D (Recommended)**: Hybrid - combine A + C (retry on startup AND after fresh auth)
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Sync play count to Last.fm when track reaches scrobble threshold
- [ ] #2 Implement automatic scrobble queue retry mechanism (Option D recommended: startup + after fresh auth)
<!-- AC:END -->
